In recent years R is becoming one of the most commonly used programming language in the scientific community for data analysis and visualization. As an effort to provide data analysis tool kits specific to BMRB data model and easy access to BMRB data in R environment, BMRB has developed RBMRB package  

RBMRB is a R package to fetch NMR chemical shift data directly from BMRB database into your own R environment. It also includes several data manipulation and visualization functions. It is using the [BMRB-API](https://github.com/uwbmrb/BMRB-API) to fetch the data from BMRB database

RBMRB is available through [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RBMRB) and [GitHub](https://github.com/uwbmrb/RBMRB)
